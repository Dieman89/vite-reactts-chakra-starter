I found out about Vite and I wanted to have a boilerplate for the technologies that I use. You can find more about these in the following links: [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Chakra](https://chakra-ui.com/), [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/).

## Installation

Clone the repo and run `yarn install`

## Start

After the successfull installation of the packages: `yarn start`

## Tests

You can build tests with Cypress. I wrote a small test to see if it's enabled. You can run it with `yarn test`
